Effective organization of payees and payment methods helps streamline expense tracking and provides
valuable insights into your spending patterns. This guide covers how to set up and manage these

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the right payee"

- Ensure payment dates match actual transaction dates

### "Should I create detailed or general entries?"

- Start general, add detail as needed
- Balance detail with maintenance overhead
- Consider your analysis needs and goals
