# UI to Manage Budget (Create, Edit, Delete) PRD v1.0

[UI to manage budget (create, edit, delete)](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/41)

## Problem Statement

Users currently create expense tracking months manually through a "Process new month" interface
without any budget planning or financial goal setting. This reactive approach prevents users from
establishing spending limits, tracking budget adherence, and making informed financial decisions.
Without budget management, users cannot transition from expense tracking to proactive financial
planning.

## Solution Overview

Replace the current month processing workflow with a budget-driven approach where users create
budgets that define their financial planning periods and spending limits. Users will manage budgets
through dedicated CRUD operations and use budget start dates to initialize their first tracking
month. The 'Default' budget concept ensures existing dashboard functionality remains unchanged while
enabling budget-aware expense management.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to create a budget with a name and start date, so that I can establish my financial planning period
2. As a user, I want to edit existing budgets, so that I can adjust my financial plans as needed
3. As a user, I want to delete unused budgets, so that I can keep my budget list clean and relevant
4. As a user, I want my dashboard to show 'Default' budget information seamlessly, so that my existing workflow isn't disrupted
5. As a user, I want budget start dates to determine my first month, so that I can align expense tracking with my financial planning cycle

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can navigate to budget management section from main navigation
- [ ] Users can create new budgets with name and start date fields
- [ ] Users can view all existing budgets in a list format
- [ ] Users can edit budget details (name only. Start date cannot be edited once budget is created unless there's no month created in that budget)
- [ ] Users can delete budgets only when no months exist in that budget
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog appears before budget removal
- [ ] Dashboard displays information from 'Default' budget without UI changes (will change that later)
- [ ] Budget start date determines the first month's date in expense tracking
- [ ] All operations provide appropriate success/error feedback
- [ ] UI follows existing application design patterns

## Out of Scope

- Budget spending limits or amount tracking
- Budget vs actual spending analysis
- Multiple budget comparison features
- Budget categories or subcategories
- Advanced budget reporting or analytics
- Budget sharing or collaboration features

## Success Metrics

1. Users can complete budget CRUD operations in under 30 seconds each
2. Zero UI regression in dashboard functionality with Default budget
3. Budget-driven month initialization works seamlessly for new users
