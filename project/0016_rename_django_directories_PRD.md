# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - PyGGy Directory Structure Refactoring

## 1. Overview
The PyGGy expense tracker application requires a directory structure refactoring to align with the new project branding and establish a scalable architecture for future growth.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **Brand Inconsistency**: The project was renamed from "Expense Tracker" to "PyGGy", but directory names still reflect the old branding
- **Confusing Structure**: Having `expense_tracker/` and `expenses/` directories is redundant and unclear
- **Limited Scalability**: Current naming doesn't accommodate future expansion with additional Django apps

## 3. Goals
- Establish consistent branding throughout the codebase
- Create a clear, professional directory structure
- Enable scalable architecture for future features
- Maintain Django best practices and conventions

## 4. Proposed Solution
Rename both configuration and app directories:
1. `expense_tracker/` → `pyggy/` (Django project configuration)
2. `expenses/` → `core/` (Main Django application)

## 5. User Stories
- As a developer, I want directory names that clearly reflect the project identity
- As a new team member, I want an intuitive project structure that's easy to understand
- As a project maintainer, I want a structure that supports adding new Django apps

## 6. Requirements

### 6.1 Functional Requirements
- FR1: Rename `expense_tracker/` directory to `pyggy/`
- FR2: Rename `expenses/` directory to `core/`
- FR3: Update all Python imports throughout the codebase
- FR4: Update all Django settings and configuration references
- FR5: Update management commands and scripts
- FR6: Ensure all existing functionality remains intact

### 6.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR1: Zero downtime during deployment
- NFR2: Maintain backward compatibility for any external integrations
- NFR3: Clear documentation of changes
- NFR4: Automated tests must pass after refactoring

## 7. Success Criteria
- All Django management commands work correctly
- Application starts and runs without import errors
- All tests pass
- No functionality regression
- Consistent naming throughout the codebase

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Missed import statements causing runtime errors
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive grep search and testing
- **Risk**: Deployment issues
  - **Mitigation**: Detailed deployment checklist and rollback plan
- **Risk**: Developer confusion during transition
  - **Mitigation**: Clear communication and documentation updates

## 9. Future Considerations
The new structure (`pyggy/` + `core/`) provides a foundation for:
- Adding API app: `api/`
- Adding reporting app: `reports/`
- Adding user management app: `accounts/`
- Integrating third-party Django apps

## 10. Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Rename `expense_tracker/` to `pyggy/`
2. **Phase 2**: Rename `expenses/` to `core/`
3. **Phase 3**: Update documentation and deployment scripts
