# Visual Screen Distinctions Enhancement PRD

**Ticket**: [Add visual screen distinctions to improve user navigation](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/173)

## Problem Statement

Users cannot quickly identify which section of the PyGGy expense tracker they are currently viewing,
as all screens share identical visual appearance with minimal distinguishing elements. This creates
navigation confusion and reduces user efficiency, particularly when switching between budget
management, expense tracking, and payment screens within the budget-scoped context.

## Solution Overview

Implement visual distinction system using color coding, subtle background elements, and enhanced
navigation indicators to help users immediately recognize their current location within the
application. The solution will focus on the existing dark terminal theme while adding contextual
visual cues that maintain the application's cohesive design. Success means users can identify their
current screen context within 1-2 seconds without reading page content.

## User Stories

1. As an expense tracker user, I want to quickly identify whether I'm in the expenses, budgets, or
   payments section, so that I can orient myself without reading page titles
1. As a budget manager, I want visual cues that distinguish dashboard screens from expense listing
   screens, so that I can navigate more efficiently between related functions
1. As a frequent user, I want consistent visual indicators for each application section, so that I
   can develop muscle memory for navigation
1. As a mobile user, I want clear visual distinctions that work on smaller screens, so that
   navigation remains intuitive on all devices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each main application section (Budgets, Dashboard, Expenses, Months, Payees, Payment Methods) has distinct visual identity
- [ ] Color coding system uses existing terminal theme colors without breaking design consistency
- [ ] Visual distinctions are subtle enough to maintain current design aesthetic while being clearly recognizable
- [ ] Section indicators work across both global context (no budget selected) and budget-scoped contexts
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintains visual distinctions on smaller screens
- [ ] Implementation preserves all existing functionality and navigation patterns
- [ ] Visual changes do not impact page load performance or accessibility standards

## Out of Scope

- Complete UI redesign or theme changes
- Addition of new navigation elements or menu structures
- Implementation of breadcrumb navigation system
- Icon redesign or replacement of Font Awesome icons
- Sidebar navigation additions or modifications
- User customization options for visual themes

## Success Metrics

1. Visual section identification time reduced to under 2 seconds (measured through user testing)
2. Zero degradation in existing page load performance
3. Implementation maintains WCAG accessibility compliance
