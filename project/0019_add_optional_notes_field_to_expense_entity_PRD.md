# PRD: Add Optional Notes Field to Expense Entity

**Ticket:** #0019  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Priority:** Normal  
**Milestone:** backlog  

## Overview

Add an optional notes field to the expense entity to allow users to capture additional context, descriptions, or comments about their expenses. This enhancement will provide users with the ability to store supplementary information that doesn't fit into the existing structured fields.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the expense tracking system captures structured data (payee, amount, type, dates) but lacks a flexible field for users to add contextual information such as:

- Detailed descriptions of what the expense covers
- Special circumstances or conditions
- Reference information or confirmation details
- Personal reminders or categorization notes

## Goals

- **Primary Goal:** Enable users to add optional descriptive notes to expenses
- **Secondary Goal:** Improve expense record keeping and context retention
- **Success Metric:** Users can successfully create and edit expenses with notes

## User Stories

### As a user, I want to...

1. **Add notes when creating a new expense** so I can capture additional context about the expense
2. **Edit notes on existing expenses** so I can update or add information later
3. **View notes on expense details** so I can review the additional context I provided
4. **See notes in expense listings** so I can quickly identify expenses with additional information

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Notes Field**
   - Optional text field (unlimited database storage)
   - Form enforces 1024 character limit for UI purposes
   - Supports multi-line text input via textarea
   - Nullable and blank in database

2. **Form Integration**
   - Notes field appears in expense creation form
   - Notes field appears in expense editing form
   - Uses textarea widget for multi-line input
   - Form-level validation enforces 1024 character limit
   - Field is clearly labeled and positioned logically

3. **Display Integration**
   - Notes displayed in expense detail view when present
   - Notes indicated in expense list view (if present)
   - Proper formatting and readability

### User Interface Requirements

1. **Form Layout**
   - Notes field positioned after "Started At" field
   - Clear label: "Notes (optional)"
   - Placeholder text: "Add additional notes or context about this expense"
   - Character counter showing remaining characters

2. **Detail View**
   - Notes section in expense details card
   - Only shown if notes exist
   - Properly formatted text display

3. **List View**
   - Subtle indicator when notes are present (e.g., small icon)
   - No direct notes display to maintain clean layout

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- No impact on existing query performance
- Minimal additional storage overhead

### Compatibility

- Backward compatible with existing expenses (no notes)
- No changes to existing API contracts
- Existing functionality remains unchanged

### Usability

- Intuitive field placement and labeling
- Responsive design across devices
- Accessible form controls

## Technical Constraints

- Database field: TEXT type (unlimited storage)
- Form validation: 1024 character limit for user interface
- Optional field (blank=True, null=True)
- Database migration required for existing data
- No impact on existing expense processing logic

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done

1. ✅ Notes field added to Expense model as TEXT field
2. ✅ Database migration created and tested
3. ✅ Expense forms include notes field with textarea widget
4. ✅ Form validation enforces 1024 character limit
5. ✅ Expense detail view displays notes when present
6. ✅ Expense list view indicates presence of notes
7. ✅ All existing functionality remains working

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Create Expense with Notes**
   - User can add notes when creating new expense
   - Notes are saved correctly to database
   - Form validates 1024 character limit

2. **Edit Expense Notes**
   - User can edit notes on existing expenses
   - Changes are saved properly
   - Can clear notes completely

3. **View Expense Notes**
   - Notes display in expense detail view
   - Notes are formatted properly
   - Empty notes don't show unnecessary UI elements

4. **List View Integration**
   - Expenses with notes show visual indicator
   - List performance not impacted
   - Clean layout maintained

## Future Considerations

- Rich text formatting (future enhancement)
- Notes search functionality
- Notes in expense export features
- Notes history/versioning

## Dependencies

- Django migration system
- Existing expense model and forms
- Current template structure

## Timeline

- **Development:** 1-2 days
- **Testing:** 1 day
- **Deployment:** Immediate (no special deployment requirements)
