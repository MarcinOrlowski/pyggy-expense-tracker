# Footer Layout Rework PRD

**Last Updated**: 2025-02-06
**Ticket**: [Rework footer layout with split design](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/52)

## Problem Statement

The current footer has a simple centered layout that doesn't effectively organize information or
provide easy access to important links. Users need quick access to both application information and
project resources. The lack of visual hierarchy makes it difficult to distinguish between different
types of footer content.

## Solution Overview

Implement a split footer layout with left-aligned application information (copyright, version) and
right-aligned action links (issue tracker, GitHub repository). The footer will use flexbox for
responsive behavior, stacking vertically on mobile devices. This creates a clear visual hierarchy
and improves navigation to important resources.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see copyright and version information clearly displayed, so that I know what version of the application I'm using
2. As a developer, I want easy access to the issue tracker and repository, so that I can report bugs or contribute to the project
3. As a mobile user, I want the footer to be readable and well-organized on small screens, so that I can access all footer information easily

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Footer is split into two distinct sections (left and right aligned)
- [ ] Left section contains copyright notice and application version
- [ ] Right section contains links to issue tracker and GitHub repository
- [ ] Layout uses flexbox with space-between alignment
- [ ] Footer stacks vertically on mobile devices (screens < 768px)
- [ ] All links open in new tabs and are properly styled
- [ ] Footer maintains consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Out of Scope

- Dynamic version retrieval from backend
- Additional footer sections or content
- Footer animations or transitions
- Social media links
- Newsletter signup
- Site map or additional navigation

## Success Metrics

1. Footer renders correctly on all screen sizes without layout issues
2. All links are functional and open in appropriate tabs
3. Implementation maintains existing visual consistency with purple border
