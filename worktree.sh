# Git Worktree Helper Tool - Enhanced script for complete worktree lifecycle management
# Supports creating/opening worktrees, safely closing them, and displaying ticket information
# Usage: ./worktree.sh <command> <ticket_number>
#
# Commands:
#   open  <ticket>  - Create and open worktree for ticket
#   close <ticket>  - Delete branch and remove worktree (safe deletion only)
#   info  <ticket>  - Show ticket details and worktree status
#
# Examples:
#   ./worktree.sh open 42   - Create worktree for ticket #42
#   ./worktree.sh close 42  - Close and cleanup worktree for ticket #42
#   ./worktree.sh info 42   - Show info about ticket #42 and its worktree status
