# Add Text Labels Next to Icons in Main Toolbar Action Buttons PRD

**Ticket**: [Add text labels next to icons in main toolbar action buttons](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/92)

## Problem Statement

Currently main toolbar action buttons only show icons which may not be immediately clear to users.
New users and those unfamiliar with FontAwesome icons must rely on hover tooltips to understand
button purposes. This creates a barrier to intuitive navigation and reduces the application's
accessibility and user-friendliness.

## Solution Overview

Add descriptive text labels next to existing icons in the main navigation toolbar buttons. This will
make button purposes immediately obvious without requiring user interaction or icon knowledge. The
enhancement will maintain existing styling while improving readability and user experience through
clear, accessible button labels.

## User Stories

1. As a new user, I want to see text labels on toolbar buttons, so that I can immediately understand
   what each button does without guessing
1. As a user with visual impairments, I want clear text labels alongside icons, so that I can
   navigate the application more easily
1. As any user, I want obvious button labels, so that I can quickly access different sections
   without hovering for tooltips

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All main toolbar navigation buttons display both icon and descriptive text
- [ ] Text labels are concise and clearly describe button functionality
- [ ] Existing button functionality and routing remains unchanged
- [ ] Visual design maintains consistency with current application styling
- [ ] Labels are visible on desktop and tablet viewports
- [ ] Accessibility attributes (aria-label, title) are preserved
- [ ] Responsive design works appropriately across different screen sizes

## Out of Scope

- Modifying secondary action buttons in tables or lists
- Changing icon choices or color schemes
- Adding text labels to footer buttons
- Mobile-specific layout optimizations
- Internationalization of text labels

## Success Metrics

1. Toolbar buttons display both icons and text labels on desktop/tablet viewports
2. No regression in existing functionality or styling
3. Improved visual clarity verified through manual testing
