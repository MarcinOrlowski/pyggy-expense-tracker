# Global Payment Methods Management PRD

**Ticket**: [Implement global payment methods management](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/python-expense-tracker/issues/99)

## Problem Statement
Users cannot manage payment methods through the application interface and must rely on Django admin access. This creates a dependency on technical administrators for a basic configuration task. Non-technical users (budget managers) cannot add or modify payment methods independently.

## Solution Overview
Add a user-friendly interface for managing payment methods directly within the application. Users will be able to create, edit, and delete payment methods without needing Django admin access. Payment methods remain global across all budgets, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.

## User Stories
1. As a budget manager, I want to add new payment methods through the UI, so that I can track expenses with my preferred payment options
2. As a user, I want to edit payment method names, so that I can correct typos or update naming conventions
3. As an administrator, I want to delete unused payment methods, so that the list remains clean and relevant

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can view all payment methods in a dedicated management page
- [ ] Users can create new payment methods with a name
- [ ] Users can edit existing payment method names
- [ ] Users can delete payment methods not associated with any expense items
- [ ] System prevents deletion of payment methods in use
- [ ] All changes are immediately reflected across all budgets

## Out of Scope
- Payment method categorization or grouping
- Payment method icons or visual customization
- Budget-specific payment method restrictions
- Import/export functionality
- Payment method usage analytics

## Success Metrics
1. 100% of payment method management tasks completed without Django admin access
2. Zero data integrity issues after 30 days of usage
3. Payment method creation time under 30 seconds
