# Docker Configuration for Development PRD

**Last Updated**: 2025-02-06
**Ticket**: [Add Docker configuration for development and production environments](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/26)

## Problem Statement

Developers need to manually set up Python environment, install dependencies, and configure the
application each time they clone the repository. New team members spend 30-60 minutes on initial
setup. Environment inconsistencies between developers cause "works on my machine" issues.

## Solution Overview

Add Docker containerization using compose.yml to provide a consistent, one-command development
environment setup. Developers will run `docker compose up` to have a fully functional application
with all dependencies. The solution preserves existing development workflows including code
hot-reloading and database persistence.

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to start the application with one command, so that I can begin coding immediately
2. As a new team member, I want a consistent development environment, so that I avoid configuration issues
3. As a developer, I want my code changes to reflect immediately, so that I maintain my development workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Application starts with `docker compose up` command
- [ ] All Python dependencies are installed automatically
- [ ] SQLite database persists data between container restarts
- [ ] Code changes trigger automatic application reload
- [ ] Static files and SCSS compilation work within container
- [ ] Container uses Python 3.12 matching production requirements

## Out of Scope

- Production deployment configuration
- Multiple database options (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Docker Swarm or Kubernetes configuration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Performance optimization for production

## Success Metrics

1. Setup time reduced to under 5 minutes
2. Zero environment-related issues in first month after implementation
