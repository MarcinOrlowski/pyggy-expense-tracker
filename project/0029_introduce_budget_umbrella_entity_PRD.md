# Budget Umbrella Entity PRD v1.0

**Ticket**: [#29 - Introduce Budget umbrella entity for expense categorization and tracking](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/python-pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/29)

## Problem Statement

<<<<<<< HEAD
Users cannot organize expenses into budget categories or set spending limits. The current system
tracks individual expenses but lacks grouping functionality for financial planning and budget
management. This prevents users from tracking spending against predetermined budget limits.

## Solution Overview

Introduce a Budget model that serves as an umbrella entity to group related expenses under budget
categories. The solution will establish the database schema and relationships without UI
implementation. Budget entities will be seeded through database initialization for immediate use in
tracking expense categorization.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want my monthly expenses to be associated with budget categories, so that I can
   track spending by category
2. As a user, I want budgets to have configurable spending limits, so that I can monitor my spending
   against planned amounts
3. As a system administrator, I want default budget categories seeded in the database, so that users
   have immediate access to common budget types

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Budget model created with fields: name, start_date, initial_amount (default 0)
- [ ] Month model updated with mandatory ForeignKey to Budget
- [ ] Database migration successfully applies Budget model and Month relationship
- [ ] Single "Default" budget seeded through management command
- [ ] Budget balance calculations correctly account for expenses in linked months
- [ ] Delete protection prevents removing budgets with linked months

## Out of Scope

- User interface for budget management (CRUD forms and views)
- Budget visualization or reporting features
- Budget alerts or notifications
- Monthly/periodic budget reset functionality
- Budget sharing between users
- UI components for month-to-budget assignment

## Success Metrics

1. All months must be linked to a budget category
2. Budget balance calculations accurately reflect expense totals from linked months
3. System maintains referential integrity between budgets and months
