# Refactor Month Entity to BudgetMonth PRD

**Ticket**: [Refactor Month entity to BudgetMonth for better semantic clarity](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/151)

## Problem Statement

The current Month model uses a generic name that doesn't clearly convey its purpose in the
budget management context. Developers working with the codebase must understand implicit
context to know this entity represents budget months. This naming ambiguity reduces code
readability and makes the codebase less self-documenting.

## Solution Overview

Rename the Month model to BudgetMonth throughout the entire codebase to better reflect
its domain purpose. This refactoring will improve code clarity by making the model name
explicitly describe what it represents. Success means all references to the Month model
are updated to BudgetMonth with no functional changes to the application behavior.

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want model names to be semantically clear, so that I can understand the codebase without additional context
2. As a developer, I want consistent domain terminology, so that the code is self-documenting and maintainable
3. As a developer, I want to work with BudgetMonth instead of Month, so that the purpose of the entity is immediately obvious

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Month model class is renamed to BudgetMonth
- [ ] All Python imports referencing Month are updated to BudgetMonth
- [ ] All database relationships pointing to Month are updated
- [ ] All Django admin, forms, and views referencing Month are updated
- [ ] All templates referencing Month model are updated
- [ ] Database migration successfully renames the table to budget_month
- [ ] All existing tests pass with the new model name
- [ ] No functional changes to application behavior

## Out of Scope

- Changes to user-facing terminology or UI text
- Performance optimizations or additional features
- Backwards compatibility with old API endpoints
- Migration rollback functionality
- Changes to Month-related business logic

## Success Metrics

1. Zero references to old Month model remain in codebase after refactoring
2. All existing tests pass without modification to test logic
3. Application functionality remains identical to pre-refactoring state
