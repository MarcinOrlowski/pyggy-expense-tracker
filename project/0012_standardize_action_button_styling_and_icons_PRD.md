# Standardize Action Button Styling and Icons PRD

**: [Standardize action button styling and icons in table rows](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/12)

## Problem Statement

Action buttons in table rows currently use inconsistent custom colors and may have icons that look
like status indicators rather than action buttons. Users may find it difficult to distinguish
between status information and actionable elements, leading to confusion about what can be clicked
or interacted with. This inconsistency degrades the overall user experience and visual cohesion of
the application.

## Solution Overview

Remove custom colors from all action buttons in table rows (except delete actions which should
maintain warning color) and ensure icons clearly represent actions rather than status. Standardize
the visual design across all table views to create a consistent, intuitive interface where users can
easily identify actionable elements from status indicators.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to quickly identify which elements in tables are clickable actions, so that I
   can efficiently navigate and interact with the interface
2. As a user, I want consistent visual styling across all table views, so that I can rely on
   familiar patterns throughout the application
3. As a user, I want clear action icons that represent what will happen when clicked, so that I can
   confidently perform tasks without confusion

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All action buttons in table rows use default styling (no custom colors except delete)
- [ ] Delete actions consistently use warning color styling
- [ ] Icons clearly indicate actions rather than status (e.g., check mark for "mark as paid" instead
  of circle-check)
- [ ] Visual design is consistent across all table views in the application
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact after styling changes
- [ ] Action buttons maintain proper accessibility attributes (aria-label, title)

## Out of Scope

- Changes to button functionality or behavior
- Addition of new action buttons or features
- Modification of non-table action buttons
- Changes to form action buttons
- Mobile responsive adjustments beyond existing behavior

## Success Metrics

1. Visual consistency achieved across 6+ table templates within implementation timeframe
2. All action buttons follow standardized color scheme (default + warning for delete)
3. Zero functional regressions reported after implementation
