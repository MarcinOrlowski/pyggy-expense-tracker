# Split Application Files into One-File-One-Class Model PRD

**Ticket**: [Split application files into one-file-one-class model for better granularity](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/pyggy-expense-tracker/issues/102)

## Problem Statement

The current codebase has large monolithic files containing multiple classes and functions, making
code maintenance and editing difficult. `models.py` (606 lines, 7 classes), `views.py` (714 lines,
24 functions), and `forms.py` (357 lines, 6 classes) create bottlenecks for development. This leads
to increased merge conflicts when multiple developers work on different features and makes it harder
to locate and modify specific functionality.

## Solution Overview

Refactor the Django expenses app by splitting large monolithic files into smaller, focused modules
following logical grouping principles. Each model class will get its own file, views will be grouped
by functional area, and forms will be organized by related functionality. This incremental approach
maintains Django framework compatibility while significantly improving code organization and
developer productivity.

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to find specific model definitions quickly, so that I can understand and
   modify business logic efficiently
1. As a developer, I want to work on expense features without touching payment code, so that I can
   avoid merge conflicts with other developers
1. As a maintainer, I want clear separation between functional areas, so that I can review and
   approve changes more effectively
1. As a new team member, I want to understand the codebase structure easily, so that I can
   contribute faster

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `models.py` is split into 7 separate files: `budget.py`, `payee.py`, `payment_method.py`, `month.py`, `expense.py`, `expense_item.py`, `settings.py`
- [ ] `views.py` is split into 7 functional modules: `dashboard.py`, `expense.py`, `month.py`, `payment.py`, `payee.py`, `payment_method.py`, `budget.py`
- [ ] `forms.py` is split into 5 logical modules: `expense.py`, `payment.py`, `payee.py`, `budget.py`, `payment_method.py`
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Django admin functionality remains intact
- [ ] All URL patterns work correctly with new view module structure
- [ ] Import statements are updated throughout the codebase to use new structure

## Out of Scope

- Adding new functionality or features
- Modifying business logic or model behavior
- Changing database schema or migrations
- Adding new tests beyond ensuring existing ones pass
- Refactoring other Django apps in the project
- Performance optimizations or code style improvements

## Success Metrics

1. All 606 lines in `models.py` distributed across 7 files with largest file <100 lines
2. All 714 lines in `views.py` distributed across 7 modules with largest module <200 lines  
3. Zero test failures after refactoring completion
4. All Django framework integrations (admin, migrations, URL routing) continue working
